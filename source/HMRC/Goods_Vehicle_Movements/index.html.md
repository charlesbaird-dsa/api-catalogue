## Description:
This API provides resources related to the Goods Vehicle Movement Service.

The Goods Vehicle Movement Service (GVMS):

Links declaration references together. This means the person moving goods only needs to present one reference at the frontier to prove that their goods have pre-lodged declarations

Links the movement of goods to declarations, meaning they can be automatically arrived and departed in HMRC systems in near-real-time

Notifies users via your software whether their inbound goods have been successfully cleared in HMRC systems by the time they arrive in the UK.
