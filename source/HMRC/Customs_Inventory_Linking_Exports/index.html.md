## Description:
This API enables the functionality to support the Inventory Linking Export process. Inventory Linking controls and monitors cargo moving through temporary storage facilities, and allows the movement/transition through frontiers.

There are three functional areas;

Consolidation This enables the combining of consignments into one master consignment, or splitting into multiple consignments.
Movement Records the movement of consignments within Customs controlled storage facilities.
Query The querying of data held within the Inventory Linking Export database.
Within each of these functional areas, there are multiple message types, each performing a specific activity.
