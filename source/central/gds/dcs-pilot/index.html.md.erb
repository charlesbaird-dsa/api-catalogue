**Description:**

The Document Checking Service (DCS) pilot is for non-public sector organisations that want to find out if British passports are valid.
The DCS acts as an interface between a service and HM Passport Office.
Your service sends a passport check request to the DCS. Or does it?
The DCS validates the request and sends it to HM Passport Office.
HM Passport Office checks the passport data against their database and sends a response back to the DCS.
The DCS sends the response to your service as outlined in check if a passport is valid.
