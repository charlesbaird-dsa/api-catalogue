## Description

[GOV.UK PaaS](https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/) allows government departments to host web facing services in the AWS cloud in Dublin and London regions.

[GOV.UK PaaS](https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/) is built on the Open Source [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/) platform.

There are two major versions of the API, v2 and v3.

The API provides a comprehensive set of resources to manage the state of your Cloud Foundry Organisation, spaces, services and applications.

See the [GOV.UK PaaS Technical Documentation for Users](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/) for more information.

The API handles all requests from the [Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/) which is the primary user interface for users of the platform.
