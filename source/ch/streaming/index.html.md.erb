## Description

The Companies House streaming API gives you access to realtime data changes of the information held at Companies House. This delivers the same information that is available through the on-demand REST API GET requests, but instead pushes data to your client as it changes, through a long-running connection that you first establish.

Streams include:

- company information
- filing history
- insolvency cases
- charges
