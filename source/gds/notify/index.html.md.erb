## Description

GOV.UK Notify allows government departments to send emails, text messages and letters to their users. The API contains:

- the public-facing REST API for GOV.UK Notify, which teams can integrate with using our clients
- an internal-only REST API built using Flask to manage services, users, templates and more (this is what the admin app talks to)
- asynchronous workers built using Celery to put things on queues and read them off to be processed, sent to providers, updated and more
