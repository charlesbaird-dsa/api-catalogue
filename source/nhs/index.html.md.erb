# NHS APIs

The NHS has multiple APIs that allow you to syndicate content from the NHS website.

This includes health topics such as conditions and symptoms, and also service information such as pharmacies and hospitals.

See the [NHS APIs website](https://developer.api.nhs.uk/nhs-api) page for a summary of the NHS APIs.

See the [NHS API documentation](https://developer.api.nhs.uk/documentation) for information on each API.
