## Description:
[GOV.UK PaaS](https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/) allows government departments to host web facing services in the AWS cloud in Dublin and London regions. [GOV.UK PaaS](https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/) is built on the Open Source [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/) platform. There are two major versions of the API, v2 and v3. The API provides a comprehensive set of resources to manage the state of your Cloud Foundry Organisation, Spaces, Services and Applications. [GOV.UK PaaS Technical Documentation for Users](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/) The  API  handles all requests from the [Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/) which is the primary user interface for users of the platform.
