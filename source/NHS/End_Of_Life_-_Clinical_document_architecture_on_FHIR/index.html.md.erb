Both projects will deliver the same capability.-n-nFurther Information-n-nThis FHIR Document specification is based on and intended to be used alongside the published FHIR DSTU2 1.0.1 (October 2015) specification.-n-nNote-n-nThis FHIR Document specification is published as a 'work in progress' version and as such is subject to change.
