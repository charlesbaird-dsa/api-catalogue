## Description:
This project specifically supports the development of a digital end of life care interoperability capability, which uses a clinically-assured information standard SCCI 1580 to support the sharing of end of life care records. It supports the development and a pilot implementation of the end of life care interoperability API which will allow sharing and updating of a digital end of life care record. This work is based on a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) aimed at addressing the Urgent and Emergency Care use case.
