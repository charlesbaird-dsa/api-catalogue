## Description:
The National Data Opt-out Programme (NDOP) is a product of the National Data Guardian (NDG) review on data security and how individuals' data is used and shared by healthcare organizations. NDOP has been created to provide a model that will allow each individual patient to have control over specific data, being able to choose the purposes for which data can be shared.-n-nNDOP will provide a mechanism for patients registered with a GP in England to control data sharing preferences.-n-nThe initial phase will provide an on-line portal where patients can use a standard web browser to set their data sharing preferences. Additional mechanisms will be introduced at a later date, including GP Practice Systems, mobile devices and off-line systems.
