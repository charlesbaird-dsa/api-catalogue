25/08/2020,,1110049,,Messaging Exchange for Social care and Health (MESH),"The Message Exchange for Social care and Health (MESH) component of the Spine allows messages and files to be delivered to registered recipients via a java client. Users register for a mailbox and install the client. The MESH client manages the sending of messages which users (typically user systems) have placed in an outbox directory on their machine.-n-nIt similarly manages the downloading of messages and files which other users have placed in the user’s virtual inbox on the Spine. The MESH server has been designed with an underlying HTTP based protocol. This protocol is capable of being used directly where user systems wish to bypass the MESH client or where they want to construct their own clients. Thus the MESH service will become a direct ‘store and retrieve’ messaging mechanism between endpoints as a new asynchronous pattern for Spine consumers. MESH uses a RESTful paradigm and thus messages which are send via mesh are POSTed to a MESH virtual outbox and recipients retrieve messages through a GET to their virtual inbox. The following document summarises the MESH HTTP API which may be used by clients directly or over which other SOAP or other APIs may be overlaid.-n-nPlease note that the Production Server listed in the Console of this Apiary page refers to NHS Digital's Solution Assurance Integration test environment and not Live.

25/08/2020,,1110055,,National Record Locator - FHIR API,"There is currently no national solution for locating and sharing patient records across health and care systems. The National Record Locator (NRL) will enable an authorised clinician, care worker and/or administrator, in any health or care setting, to access a patient’s information to support that patient’s direct care. In turn, NRL will empower professionals, patients, and communities, strengthen primary, secondary, and acute care and introduce system efficiencies. This new national capability will aim to complement local digital initiatives (including Shared Care Records) and enhance the level of digital maturity across Health and Care. Phase 1 aims to demonstrate this capability, testing the concept of cross border interoperability and crucially enabling the power of local Shared Care Records (where they exist) to become woven into the NRL fabric from the outset.-n-nNHS Digital intends for the NRL to be accessible to all localities in 2019, opening up the possibility of achieving the ‘holy grail of interoperability’ in the months and years that follow. The NHS England Target Architecture also states that platforms moving forward will be expected to use common national services, standards, and governance processes to ensure national cohesion, including the NRL. More information can be found at the NHS England page on Interoperability.-n-nIn 2016, NHS Digital concluded a proof of concept project to test the implementation challenges of the NRL and to measure its potential service impact and benefits. A decision was made to continue with the development of the NRL in four key regions across the NHS identified for their digital maturity as outlined below. Working initially with urgent and emergency care, the NRL will enable cross border, cross organisation and cross sector interoperability. Our plan therefore is to integrate with:-n-n    North West, North East, Yorkshire, and London Ambulance Services and Mental Health Trusts-n    The Lancashire Patient Record Exchange Service-n    Cheshire Care Record-n-nProving the success of such integrations in Phase 1 will allow all records held within local shared records to be accessible via NRL in Phase 2 and beyond.",https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/nrl/,,,NHS,,,,National Health Service,central
