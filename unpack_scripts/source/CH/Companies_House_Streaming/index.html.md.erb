## Description:
The Companies House streaming API gives you access to realtime data changes of the information held at Companies House. This delivers the same information that is available through the on-demand REST API GET requests, but instead pushes data to your client as it changes, through a long-running connection that you first establish. Streams include: - company information - filing history - insolvency cases - charges
