## Documentation URL:

## Description:
The National Pathology FHIR Messaging Specification supports the ability to share pathology results in NHS primary and secondary care settings. This release focuses on haematology and clinical biochemistry (also known as chemical pathology) test reporting. It defines a FHIR STU3 payload to allow test results to be sent from a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) to a requesting system. It is anticipated that the messaging specification and implementation guidance will be updated following First of Type (FoT) implementation.
