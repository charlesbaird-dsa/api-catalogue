## Description:
This API specification defines standards for interactions between electronic hospital patient medicines administration (ePMA) systems and hospital pharmacy or stock control systems.-n-nIn particular, it defines the structure of the FHIR MedicationRequest resource. The MedicationRequest acts as a medication order request to the pharmacy for a given patient under care on the ward.-n-nThis is an API specification only - there is no national service associated with it.-n-nThis guidance is applicable to both STU3 and R4 implementations of the FHIR standard. It highlights differences between the STU3 and R4 MedicationRequest resource and provides guidance on how to future proof an STU3 implementation if an uplift to R4 is expected.-n
