# HMRC: Agent Authorisation

## Endpoint URL:
 - [https://api.service.hmrc.gov.uk](https://api.service.hmrc.gov.uk)

## Documentation URL:
 - [https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/agent-authorisation-api/1.0](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/agent-authorisation-api/1.0)

## Description:
This API allows tax agents to request authorisation to act on a client's behalf for a specific Making Tax Digital (MTD) tax service and have the option to cancel the authorisation request.-n-nThe API also allows the agent to check the status of authorisations already requested and query active or inactive relationships.-n-nThis API has no effect on the existing XML API.-n-nChange Log-n-nYou can find the changelog in the agent-authorisation-api GitHub repository <https://github.com/hmrc/agent-authorisation-api/blob/master/CHANGE_LOG.md>.-n-nWhy use this API?-n-nAgents often use software to perform services for their clients. The API will benefit these agents as it allows them to create a request for authorisation to act on a client's behalf for a specific Making Tax Digital service directly through software.-n-nThis process involves the agent providing their own personal identifier and some information about the client that they wish to act on behalf of. This generates a link that the agent can send to their client. The client can then follow this link to authorise the agent for a service.-n-nThis API will save an agent time as they currently need to use an Agent Services user interface to create an authorisation request using their agent services account.-n
